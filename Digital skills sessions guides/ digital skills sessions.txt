Newcastle Libraries deliver basic digital skills sessions to help citizens use a computer or other electronic devices or specific online services. These sessions are mostly delivered on a one-to-one basis with the help of a guide which the attendee can take away and re-use.

The sessions have been called Internet taster sessions for many years before being renamed Digital skills sessions.
